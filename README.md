### Summary

I have finally completed this project. His work was fun! I have practiced everything I can. I'm most proud of the Jquery code, which allowed me to create beautiful animations on all pages by clicking on the buttons.
Creating this site was simple compared to other frontent-mentor challenge, as everyone has access to figma files.
